# Big-Data-Machine-Learning---MSc-in-Data-Science-Presentation

This master's presentation introduces the concepts of big data and machine learning to provide an overview of these rapidly evolving technologies. It covers the challenges of dealing with massive amounts of data, and how big data tools and technologies can be used to store, process and analyze this data. The presentation also explores different machine learning algorithms and techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and neural networks. The goal of the presentation is to provide a foundational understanding of big data and machine learning, including their applications and potential for future developments. The presentation would likely include case studies and examples to illustrate the concepts discussed, and would be tailored to a non-technical audience.
